        Bitropy is built by professionals with deep experience across enterprise software, AI engineering, security, and compliance.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
        We've spent years working with complex, regulated environments—helping organizations scale technology without losing control, transparency, or trust.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
        Our team understands AI from both sides: how leaders think about risk, cost, and accountability—and how engineers build, deploy, and operate systems in production.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
        We've seen firsthand where AI adoption breaks down: fragmented tooling, missing guardrails, unclear ownership, rising costs, and growing regulatory pressure.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
        That experience shapes everything we build. Bitropy is designed by people who have operated real systems, supported real teams, and solved real problems—not just experimented with models.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600">
        We believe enterprises don't need more AI tools. They need a foundation they can trust.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-600 font-semibold">
        That's why we're building Bitropy.
