        Breaking Down AI Barriers for Enterprises
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        For years, regulated industries have watched the AI boom from the sidelines. Banks, pharma innovators, and insurers want to move fast—but compliance, privacy, and vendor lock-in keep holding them back. The rules are complex, and the risks are high.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        At Bitropy, we saw that frustration up close and decided to build a different path. A path where enterprises can innovate boldly and stay fully in control.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        Our modular AI infrastructure lets organizations deploy secure, production-grade AI in under two weeks—no compromises, no black boxes.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        We've helped a pharma company cut document processing time by 70% while staying fully compliant, and enabled a global bank to speed up KYC and AML operations by 60%, all with full transparency and auditability.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        What makes Bitropy different isn't just the tech—it's the people. We're a team of passionate builders, engineers, and problem-solvers who've spent years inside enterprise AI. We know how hard this journey can be and we're here to make it possible, faster, and freer than ever before.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-slate-500">
        We believe AI should belong to those who create it. And we can't wait to help you break down the barriers and build what's next.
